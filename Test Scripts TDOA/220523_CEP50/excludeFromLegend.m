function excludeFromLegend(graphObj)
% excludeFromLegend(graphObj)
%
% Modifies the supplied graphics object such that it will not appead in a
% legend; useful for plotting annotations that do not belong in the legend,
% such as dashed lines between a label and the appropriate line or
% marker.
%
% The handles are returned from the plotting command that was used to
% generate them, such as
%   h = plot(...)
% or
%   h = text(...)
%
% Alternatively, an axis object can be searched with the findall or findobj
% commands, such as:
%   h1 = findall(gcf);
%   h2 = findall(gcf,'Type','text');
%   h3 = findobj(gcf,'Type','text');
%
% If multiple graph objects are input the command is applied to each.
%
% Inputs:
%   graphObj        Graphics object handles (scalar or array)
