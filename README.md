# TDoA
A repo containing MATLAB test scripts that went into the development and finalization of the Time-difference of Arrival (TDoA) algorithm for the passive geolocation system both, in 2D and 3D. The codes also contain scripts that build up to the calculation and estimation of Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDoP).
